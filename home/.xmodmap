! Assign the Meta_L event to the (right) CONTROL key (keycode 67),
! assign the Control_L and Control_R events to the COMMAND keys
! (keycodes 63 and 71).
keycode 67 = Meta_L
keycode 63 = Control_L
keycode 71 = Control_R
! Redefine the related modifiers keys, because we have now

! Change the left OPTION/ALT key (keycode 66) to be Alt
